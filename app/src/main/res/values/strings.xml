    <string name="instructions">The objective of the game is to score as high as possible. You can increase your score by jumping from branch to branch.

        The way you jump from each branch is by pressing and holding on the screen to charge up the jump, then releasing to jump.

        The branches will be different distances away, so you have to charge your jumps accordingly.

        Your high-score will be saved and displayed during each run.</string>
